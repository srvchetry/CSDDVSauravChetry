<strong>About this Visualization</strong><br><br>	

This project is a D3JS version of my <a href = "https://public.tableau.com/profile/saurav7394#!/vizhome/ImmigrationandRemittancesoverviewofthemostimmigratingnationsv2/Dashboard?publish=yes" target="_blank"> Midterm Project</a>. 
This narrative visualization is inspired by the Drill Down Narrative Visualization <a href = "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/10/11/business/20081011_BEAR_MARKETS.html?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed" target="_blank"> How This Bear Market Compares </a><br><br>

This project includes 3 world maps each being a chloropleth showing emigration, remittances and GDP data for the countries. The legends using color palletes are used for understanding the map and drilling down on top countries 
in each map. Each map is interactive, meaning on clicking any country on any map would populate the interactive bar chart and a non-interactive line chart.

<br><br><b>Conclusion:</b> Remittances contribute to the GDP of the countries. Some countries( for e.g. Nepal ) have a third of their GDP from inward remittances.
Emigration is a brain-drain phenomenon for the country, but that country also gets economic benefits from it.
